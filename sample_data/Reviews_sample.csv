The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than most."""

Without it, the cold medicine is cruel; it works but it tastes like plastic. You might as well take the plastic tags off a new shirt and chew on them to relieve your sore throat. The actual product tastes great and I always buy it when I'm sick."""
