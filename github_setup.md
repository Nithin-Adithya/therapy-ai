# GitHub Setup Instructions

Your Git repository has been successfully initialized locally. To complete the deployment to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**:
   - Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
   - Name your repository (e.g., "therapy-ai")
   - Add an optional description
   - Choose public or private visibility
   - Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these files)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Configure the remote and push your code**:
   - Replace "yourusername" with your actual GitHub username in the commands below
   - Open a terminal in your project directory and run:

```powershell
# Add the remote repository
& "C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe" remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/therapy-ai.git

# Push your code to GitHub
& "C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe" push -u origin main
```

3. **Verify your deployment**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository URL (https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/therapy-ai)
   - You should see all your project files and the README displayed

4. **Optional: Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to Settings > Pages
   - Select the "main" branch as the source
   - Click Save
   - Your project will be available at https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/therapy-ai/

Congratulations! Your Therapy AI project is now successfully deployed to GitHub.
